# Plan to Build paperless-node

- **Review Swagger**: Inspect docs/ swagger definition and note resources, authentication, and pagination conventions.
- **Bootstrap Project**: Initialize a TypeScript Node library with linting, testing, bundling, and build scripts aligned with repo tooling.
- **Generate Client Types**: Use the swagger schema to produce typed request/response models and an HTTP layer (e.g., axios wrapper) with error handling.
- **Implement Modules**: Group API calls by resource (documents, tasks, tags, users, etc.), implement endpoints, and cover auth helpers.
- **Add Tests**: Write unit tests for the HTTP layer and resource modules, and add integration smoke tests using mocked swagger responses.
- **Document Usage**: Provide README examples, publishable entry points, and changelog notes for consuming Paperless-ngx APIs.
- **Release Prep**: Configure package metadata, versioning, and CI pipeline steps for publish and verification.
